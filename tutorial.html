               <h4>Where do I study best and why?</h4>
            <p>This isn't an easy question to answer for many who perhaps haven't studied a lot, or haven't studied for some time. If you find yourself sitting at home unable to study due to distractions, try going somewhere else to study, like a library or a coffee shop. However if you are easily distracted by noise and people moving about, I would advise against that coffee shop experience.</p>

              <div class="card-content">
              <h4>When do I study best?</h4>
              <p>Figuring out when you study best can really help with your work, if you work best when you have just woken up; try waking up a couple ours earlier and do some work. If you work best in the evening make sure you get home and get in those hours.</p>

              <h4>How should I study?</h4>
              <p>Everyone learns in different ways, some people learn through reading a textbook, while others like to watch videos or listen to podcasts, some even prefer to just do past exam papers or talking about ideas with others. However you find it useful to study, it is always best to explore a range of material. Don't just put on the same channel because you like the presenter.</p>

              <h4>Are you taking care of yourself?</h4>
              <p>It may sound simple, but when the work starts to pile up taking care of yourself can often become an after-thought to getting your work done. However their have been countless studies over the years performed that not only preach the benefits of getting a decent amount of rest, but also having a nutritionally balanced diet, exercising and even socialising with friends. Make sure you do not let these things slip while keeping up to date with your work.</p>

              <h4>Do I leave things to the last minute?</h4>
              <p>Do you often find yourself cramming last minute to reach your deadlines? This may have worked previously, however you will often find that this last minute cramming will lead to high-levels of stress as you watch the clock tick down to get every word in. Planning and approaching assignments or revision ahead of time will not only reduce these stress levels; but will also give you the best opportunity  to get a high grade.</p>

                  <h4>Timetabling</h4>
                  <p>If you find you have sorted all of these things and are still struggling to keep up with your work, maybe its time to look into timetabling. When doing so it is best to first think about how many hours a week you need to put towards your studies outside of class. Get a piece of paper, or excel or many free applications to help you with this, firstly block out the things you cant miss; lessons, work and extra-curricular activities. Then block out enough time for each subject area based on how long you need for each. Keeping up with this is the most important thing, slipping up can make it very hard to get back into a routine.</p>
