			<h3>Week 1: The First Hurdle</h3>
			</header>
				<p>Week one I have started to get on with this by following the way in which the lab tutorial has been laid out. Although I have run into some issues, originally the first issue I encountered was not being able to access the Brighton domains website, and now after completing the first task of the lab tutorial, I am unable to open my Web-Page. </p>
				
				<p>Getting the Brighton domains issue sorted was rather easy as I was told to email it, and low and behold a couple hours later it was all up and running.</p>
				
				<p>Being unable to access my webpage online however was an entirely different issue. However, I remembered back to the induction. I remembered that the webpage needed to be created in the public_html file to be accessed, once I had found this out, I went on to move all the required documents over to where they could be accessed. With this I was now able to access my webpage and was ready to progress with my work.</p>
				
				<p>With my problems out of the way I went about linking both the index.html to tutorial.html and then doing the same for my contact.html page. Making sure at the end they were all easily linked together.</p>

			<h3>Week 2: The Second Week</h3>
			</header>
				<p>In the second week we have been looking at other interesting things you can do as part of a web journal. The first thing I did was add a date time stamp to the end of my last post. This is something I will continue to do as I continue my journal so that there is a record of when I have done things. </p>
				<p>We also learnt about making lists and anchors which allow you to jump from place to place on the website, which gave me a great idea to have all my weeks linked at the top of the page and a link after each post allowing the viewer to return to the top of the page. I was going to put a list into this week but with my understanding of CSS, all the lists would end up looking identical.</p>
				<p>Finally, we touched on images. With this I thought it would be nice to share some of my hobbies outside of my everyday university life. START THE REEL!</p>
				<figure>
				    <img src="images/DND.jpg" alt="Dice">
				    <figcaption>I enjoy playing DND and other boardgames with friends</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
				    <img src="images/Boxing.jpg" alt="Boxing">
				    <figcaption>I keep fit by boxing and working out</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>I ran into a small issue while I was testing the links I had made to different parts of the website; this caused me to have to have another look. However, I quickly found the issue was that I had forgot to put hashtags in the href, this was an easy fix.</p>
				<p>When validating I had a few issues such as not writing the Datetimes correctly, as I typically write my dates DD/MM/YYYY; not YYYY-MM-DD. I had also included the previous paragraph inside the image figure, and the id's for linking weeks to the main heading had spaces, which I now know is bad practice.</p>

			<h3>Week 3: The Third Hour (is how long it felt writing up that table)</h3>
			</header>
			<p>This week we have been looking at tables and layout and are going to start learning about CSS which is going to be amazing. Below is another form of list, which can be used for a "glossary of terms", which I might end up using this for listing my references at the end of my page.</p>
			<dl>
  <dt><strong>HTML</strong></dt>
    <dd>Hyper-text markup language - markup language used to structure content</dd>
  <dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
    <dd>Cascading stylesheets - used to define presentation of HTML elements</dd>
  <dt><strong>JavaScript</strong></dt>
    <dd>Scripting language for adding interactive behavior to web pages</dd>

<p> Although it doesn't look very nice at the moment, I am sure once I add some CSS all of this will look beautiful.</p>
<p> We also learned about Mark-ups, quoting lines from sources which will definitely be needed as I look into interesting things to do with CSS I will be able to quote and show all the cool things I have found. However, for now, a passage from one of my all time favorite books.</p>
<p>The opening to Stephen King's "The Gunslinger"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. The desert was theapotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what might have been parsecs in all directions. White; blinding; waterless; without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains whichsketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares,death...<p>

<p>I love this short passage, because it really illustrates the scene. Being the opening lines of the book it draws you in massively with many unanswered questions about the two men playing a not so friendly game of catch.</p>

			<h3>Week 4: Breaking The Fourth Rule</h3>
			</header>
				<p>This weeks adventure has led us into CSS, finally I am going to make this page my own and stand out a bit more. I started off this weeks work by following the guide, creating a normalized page and then creating a style sheet which would function off the whole page and that would be my own. Once this was done, I had a play around to make the page seem more my own.</p>

				    <figcaption>This is what the week three page looked like when we had finished.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>I also found out this week that all sections could be given classes allowing them to differ from one another, this is going to be very helpful as it will allow me to edit and change things as I continue on my journey of updating and creating for this web-page. I also noticed that some of my photos didn't stay within the boundaries of the wrapper. I am aware we are continuing with CSS next week so I am assuming at that point we will learn how to deal with this pesky issue, if not I will do some of my own research.</p>
				<p> I will also admit it all looks a bit funky, but as we learn about making our pages standard compliant I will probably end up overhauling all of this to make it fit within guidelines, but for now I think it looks nice.</p>

			<h3>Week 5: The Forth, The Fifth</h3>
			</header>
				<p>The Fourth, The Fifth. CSS pt. 2! This week we looked into more CSS and more standard compliance for web-pages around styling our web-pages. I started off this week by adding in the viewport to all of my pages, then loading up the web-page on my phone I found a few issues, images had not been correctly sized. I quickly rectified this with using a width : 90%, and this has sized all the images appropriately.</p>

			<h3>Week 6: Responsive of the Sixth </h3>
			</header>
				<p>This week we began to learn about responsive web development. In this we learnt about changing the size of screens between both computers, tablets and phones. This is done so that users can use any device and still access the same content and is considered a staple of good web development. Responsive web-development means that the website will change depending on what platform you view it on (e.g. Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Phone, etc...) this includes what is presented and how everything is laid out.</p>
				<a id= "Understanding_Grids"></a>
				<p>We started this by talking about grid formats, which is where individual classes are given their own area, these grids can then be arranged in any number of ways. This allows you to set up a grid consisting of as many different components you want, a 2x2 or a 4x10; with this grid layout you are then able to write in your CSS how you want this format to be presented. The below table will show you how I have arranged mine. We also learnt about the mobile first approach, this allows for your device to see if a device is a mobile and will use that layout primarily. Then looking for different sizes of screens to update to those if applicable.</p>
				
				
                    <table>
				    <tr>
				        <th><strong>Mobile First Grid-Layout</strong></th>

				<p>After I had finished all of this, I then went on to play around with text functions, making everything look nice and presentable. This included adding nice boxes to everything and making sure things were capitalised and certain things underlined.</p>
				<p>I ran into an issue after trying to deal with the new tables in that the margin surrounding the website started to leak into the content, I couldn't figure out what was causing this so currently I have had to hide the table. I am hoping to figure this out next week.</p>

			<h3>Week 7: S Club 7!</h3>
			</header>
				<p>This week we learnt about making flexible images and videos that are standard compliant and web-page responsive. This will be handy for using images in both my learning journal as well as video's and images in the tutorial. I am also looking into making my tables responsive so that they can be visible for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>
				<p>There are two ways in which you can add an image as part of developing a web-page, you can either do it in: 
			<ol>
				<li>The CSS document using "background-image", however this should only be used for presentation purposes.</li>
				<li>The other option is in the HTML files, using the img and scr commands to link an image to a specific place in the webpage, as seen with previous images.</li>
			</ol>
				<figure class="txtWrap">
				    <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/people-sun-mountain-freedom-14759272/">
				    <img src="images/balloons.jpg" alt="picture of hot air balloons">
			        <div class= "clear"></div>
			        </a>
			    </figure>
			     <p>We also looked at working with images that had text around them as well, also known as text wrapping. This allows text to wrap around a flexible image, this is great for articles where a picture takes up some space but you wish to keep them together instead of having a picture below or above the text.</p>
			     <p>Which you can see implemented here with this beautiful royalty free image of hot air balloons by Tolga Aslantürk. If you click the image it will take you to where I found it as well. This will be helpful for the tutorial as it means that I can imbed both images and videos into the tutorial without taking up massive amounts of space.</p>
				
				<p>Despite desires to also be able to work something out for my timetable I was unable to figure something out, so currently I have kept the timetable hidden it when the website is viewed on a mobile device. However I did learn about the "overflow" options available for tables. However these only seemed to cause more issues. I also figured out the issue with the margin, I had a rogue /div just laying around in my code.</p>

    			<a id="Week_8"></a>
			<h3>Week 8: The 8th attempt</h3>
			</header>
				<p>This week we learnt about responsive layouts, flexboxes and multi-columns. We have already used a lot of this back in Week 6 where we created the grid layout for the Learning Journal, setting it up so that it can be viewed on different styles of devices and be standard compliant.</p>
				<p>This time we are looking mainly for the Tutorial page, creating cards which is good for itemised lists with an order. I added in the code for the tutorial.html and the CSS making a new section for stuff on the tutorial page, as well as then adding the latter parts to the media commands section to keep everything clean and tidy.</p>
				<p>With this all set up, I have created a new wrapper for both the Tutorial page and Contact Page imaginatively called "#wrapperTutorial" and "#wrapperContact", the contact one will be for later use. But for now we shall focus on the tutorial one. I then created a new gridlayout for this tutorial wrapper; tables for which have been provided below.</p>
				<p><table class= inlineTable>
				    <tr>
				        <th><strong>Mobile (tutorial)</strong></th>
				    </tr>

				    <tr>
				        <th>footer</th>
				        <th>footer</th>
				    </tr>
				    </table>
				    
				    <table class= inlineTable>
				        <tr>
				            <th colspan="3"><strong>Desktop (tutorial)</strong></th>
				        </tr>
				        <tr>
				            <th>banner</th>
				            <th>banner</th>
				            <th>banner</th>
				        </tr>
				        <tr>
				            <th>menu</th>
				            <th>menu</th>
				            <th>menu</th>
				        </tr>
				        <tr>
				            <th>video</th>
				            <th>video</th>
				            <th>aside</th>
				        </tr>
				        <tr>
				            <th>main</th>
				            <th>main</th>
				            <th>aside</th>
				        </tr>
				        <tr>
				            <th>footer</th>
				            <th>footer</th>
				            <th>footer</th>
				        </tr>
				    </table>
				<p>The tables above represent the way in which I have set up the grids for my Tutorial Page. I originally had a few rows of main, however then I realised that it wouldn't matter as long as I wasn't introducing other elements like aside or nav. So these were removed. Also note the use of video, which is a class I will be using to upload a video for a step by step walk-through of how to achieve what I will be talking about in my tutorial.</p>
				<p>I also figured that you were able to tables that sit next to each other, this is useful as it saves space and looks a lot nicer in my opinion. Especially when already understand what each table is representing. If you don't feel free to have a look at <a href= #Understanding_Grids>this</a>. This will also allow you to view the previous way I had tables laid out.</p>

			<h3>Week 9: 999 Emergency Contact!</h3>
			</header>
				<p>For week 9 we learnt about HTML and CSS forms, which will be exceptionally handy for the Contact page. Forms are a staple part of websites and have many different uses.</p>
				
				<p>With the knowledge of what we had learnt, I went about creating my contact form, adding fields for Full Name, Email, Mobile Number, URL and a message box. I also added a submit button, this completed the functionality for what was needed, I then spent some time making sure that name, email and message were required fields. This means that if they aren't filled out the message wouldn't send. Using HTML and CSS I made it so that the contact page looked visually similar to the rest of the website.</p>

			<h3>Week 10: The End of a Journey</h3>
			</header>
			<p>With the last thing to do is making sure that the website works and runs smoothly, I have spent time ironing out any bugs or issues that have arisen from the past weeks of work. </p>
				<p>With the project finished and completed, I have successfully developed a website that is standard compliant and responsive, demonstrating my knowledge and use of both HTML and CSS. The website is both visually appealing and engaging when viewed on any device. It was at this time that I found a few bugs and many an issue when trying to deal with validating both my HTML and CSS; but with some perseverance and finally learning how to use the Inspect tool that is built into the browser (which may I add is an amazing tool to help with Web development) I managed to validate and remove all the bugs from my website.</p>
